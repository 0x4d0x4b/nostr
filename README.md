# Nostr types for Rust

This doesn't work yet.

I believe I'm parsing events correctly, but when I create an event, sign it, and publish it, I get back an "Invalid signature" notice.

try `cargo run --example demo` if you want to see what's up. You'll need a relay running at `ws://localhost:3333/ws`
